   <br>
   <strong>Karaage</strong> (唐揚げ) is a Japanese cooking technique in which 
   various foods—most often <em>chicken</em>, but also other meat and 
   fish—are deep fried in oil. The process involves lightly 
   coating small pieces of the meat or fish with a 
   combination of flour and potato starch or corn 
   starch, and frying in a light oil. The foods are 
   marinated prior to coating. The process differs from the 
   preparation of tempura, which is not marinated and uses 
   a batter for coating. Karaage is often served alone or 
   with rice and shredded cabbage.

    </em>
</p>

<h3>Marinade the Chicken</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
    <li>To prepare 1½ lb boneless, skin-on chicken thighs, 
        cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. 
        Season with ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and 
        freshly ground black pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Now, grate the ginger. Take 
        ½ tsp ginger (grated, with juice) and add them to a 
        large bowl. Next, mince or press 1 clove garlic 
        and add it to the bowl.
    </li>
    <li>Add ½ Tbsp soy sauce, ½ Tbsp sake, and ½ tsp toasted 
        sesame oil to the bowl with the ginger and garlic. 
        Whisk it all together.
    </li>
    <li>Add the chicken to the bowl with the marinade and mix 
        it with your hands. Cover and keep in the 
        refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Prepare the Deep Frying Oil</h3>
<ol>
    <li>While the chicken is marinating, prepare the oil for 
        deep-frying. Pour about 4 cups (960 ml) neutral oil 
        into a heavy-bottomed pot (I used a Dutch oven) and 
        heat it to 325ºF (160ºC) on medium heat.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Dredge the Chicken</h3>
<ol>
    <li>While the oil is heating up, dredge the chicken. 
        Prepare 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) and 2 
        Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch in separate piles.
    </li>
    <li>Lightly dredge a marinated chicken piece in the flour 
        and dust off the excess flour. Then, dredge in the 
        potato starch and remove the excess starch.
    </li>
    <li>Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Deep Fry</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Check that the oil temperature has reached 325ºF (160ºC). 
        <em><strong>Tip:</strong> If you don't have an instant read thermometer, insert 
        a wooden chopstick into the oil; you'll know it's hot 
        enough if small bubbles start to appear around the tip.</em> 
        <br>
        When the oil is hot enough, gently submerge 3 to 5 
        chicken pieces in the oil at a time; do not 
        overcrowd the pot. <em><strong>Tip:</strong> If you put too many pieces 
        in at once, the oil temperature will drop quickly, 
        and the chicken will end up absorbing too much oil.</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>First Deep-Frying:</strong> Deep-fry for 90 seconds, or until 
        the outside of the chicken is a light golden color. 
        If the chicken browns too quickly, then the oil 
        temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces 
        of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. Controlling 
        the oil temperature at all times is very important 
        for deep-frying. Transfer the chicken pieces to a 
        wire rack to drain the excess oil.
    </li>
    <li>The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken 
        as it rests on the wire rack. Continue deep-frying 
        the remaining chicken pieces. Between batches, pick 
        up and discard the crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh 
        sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from 
        becoming darker.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Second Deep-Frying:</strong> Now, heat the oil to 350ºF (180ºC). 
        Place 3 to 5 pieces of the resting chicken back into 
        the oil and deep-fry for 45 seconds, or until the skin 
        is golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to a wire 
        rack to drain the excess oil. Continue with the 
        remaining chicken pieces.
    </li>
    <li>The left photo shows the chicken pieces after the 
        first frying and the right photo shows them after 
        the second frying. You can see the chicken pieces on 
        the right are slightly darker in color.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Serve</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Serve the chicken hot. We often serve Karaage with 
        lemon wedges and dip it in Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise 
        (you can make it homemade). Sprinkle shichimi 
        togarashi (Japanese seven spice) on top for a bit of 
        spice, if desired.
    </li>
</ol>

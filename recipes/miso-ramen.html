       <strong>Ramen</strong> (拉麺, ラーメン or らーめん) is a Japanese noodle dish.
       It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles (中華麺, 
       chūkamen) served in a broth; common flavors are <em>soy sauce</em> 
       and <em>miso</em>, with typical toppings including sliced pork 
       (chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), 
       and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle 
       dishes and is a part of Japanese Chinese cuisine. 
       Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of 
       ramen, such as the <em>tonkotsu</em> (pork bone broth) ramen of 
       Kyushu and the <em>miso</em> ramen of Hokkaido.

    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-header text">Pre-Prep</h3>
    <ol class="list text">
        <li>Prepare the ramen toppings ahead of time—a day in 
            advance for the Homemade Chashu (Japanese Braised 
            Pork Belly) and Ramen Egg (Ajitsuke Tamago)—so they're 
            ready to serve with your piping-hot bowl of ramen.
        </li>
        <li>For toppings, set aside chashu, ramen egg, blanched bean 
            sprouts (or Spicy Bean Sprout Salad), frozen or 
            canned corn, Shiraga Negi (julienned long green 
            onions), chopped green onion/scallion, and a sheet of 
            nori (dried laver seaweed). For the optional 
            condiments, prepare a bottle of la-yu (Japanese chili 
            oil), pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni 
            shoga), and some white pepper powder on the table.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="sub-header text">Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <ol class="list text">
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mince or press 2 cloves garlic and add to a small 
            plate. Then, grate the ginger and add ½ tsp 
            ginger (grated) to the plate.
        </li>
        <li>Mince 1 shallot and add to the plate and set 
            these three prepared ingredients aside.
        </li>
        <li>Grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds, leaving 
            some seeds unground for texture. Set aside.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="sub-header text">Make the Soup Broth</h3>
    <ol class="list text">
        <li>Preheat a medium pot over medium-low heat. When it's 
            hot, add 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil. Then, add the 
            garlic, ginger, and shallot.
        </li>
        <li>With a wooden spatula, stir-fry until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ¼ lb ground pork and increase the heat to medium. 
            Cook the meat until it's no longer pink.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste) and 
            3 Tbsp miso. Quickly blend well with the meat before 
            they get burnt.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp sugar and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 1 Tbsp sake and 4 cups chicken stock/broth and 
            bring the mixture to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>Taste your soup and add up to 1 tsp Diamond Crystal 
            kosher salt (if necessary) and ¼ tsp white pepper 
            powder.
        </li>
        <li>Your soup broth is now done. Cover with the lid and 
            keep the soup broth simmering while you cook the 
            noodles.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="sub-header text">Prepare the Ramen Noodles</h3>
    <ol class="list text">
        <li>Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil (ramen 
            noodles already include salt in the dough). When the 
            water is boiling, ladle some of the hot water 
            into the individual ramen bowls to warm them up. 
            Meanwhile, gently shake 2 servings fresh ramen 
            noodles with your hand to separate and loosen 
            them up.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to the package 
            instructions. I usually cook the noodles al dente 
            (about 15 seconds less than the suggested cooking 
            time). Before your noodles are done cooking, empty 
            the hot water from the warmed ramen bowls.
        </li>
        <li>When the noodles are done, quickly pick them up with 
            a mesh sieve and shake out the excess water. Make 
            sure to drain the water well, as you don't want it to 
            dilute your soup. Serve the noodles into the warmed 
            bowls.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="sub-header text">Serve</h3>
    <ol class="list text">
        <li>Add the piping-hot ramen soup broth to each bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the toppings of your choice on the ramen 
            noodles and serve immediately. Add the optional 
            condiments to your Miso Ramen and enjoy.
        </li>
    </ol>
